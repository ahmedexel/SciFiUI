# Description of the assignment

For the assignment I was to to design a sci-fi movie device like a warp drive, engines, weapons system. So I decided to design a weapon system as I am passionate about shooting games and it felt the most reasonable to do.

I had a visual idea prior to making this program and I tried my best to convert my visuals to a program

Upon reflecting on the project I believe there was room for improvement

1. Time management was mas a massive hindrance to us as I delayed working on this project for time.
2. I all genuiniely believe that if I was diligant I would have did better.
3. There was many additional features I wanted to add such as a background image, extra reactive elements.
4. The Overall aesthetics of the visuals is good but there's a scope for improvement.

I had a visual idea prior to making this program and I tried my best to convert my visuals to a program

Upon reflecting on the project I believe there was room for improvement
 
1. Time management was a massive hindrance to us as I had to balance between studying and working the assignment
2. I genuinely believe that if I was more diligent I would have done a lot better.
3. There were many additional features I wanted to add such as an additional selection and Unique background Images for each selection.
4. The Overall aesthetics of the visuals is good but there's room for improvement.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
Getting a finished product was the proudest part of the assignment mainly because it was a major relief for myself to  get the project done once and for all. Getting a finalized program sufficed as a major factor for delaying the project as it seemed extremely difficult at first. After days and working On the project I managed to do this.
 
Simplifying the project, my proudest part was:-
 
- The System Origin Selection of the Program mainly because I spent the most time on it and it looks the best aesthetically.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
